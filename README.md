# StartUp


## Description Deliverable


### Elevator Pitch
This is going to be like the dino game that works on chrome, but better. The base level 
game is fun, but it lacks a few key elements that would make it great. This upgrade will be 
comparable to an ultimate mode of the game with more difficulty and obstacles. 
Besides having more content it will also be able to save a user's score and allow 
them to compare their score with others. The current game name is Mariachi Runner. 

### Design

### Key Features
- Secure login over HTTPS
- Start game and use player input to play in real time
- User can login and see their best scores
- User can also see the best scores of all time
- User can delete account and scores

### Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- HTML - Uses HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for playing the game, one for looking at scores, and one with about info.
- CSS - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes; use simple, but clear graphics and fonts; Design focuses user of the game.
- JavaScript - Provides the majority of the functionality and animations for the game. 
- Service - Back end service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving scores of the logged in person
    - retrieving the highest scores logged
- DB - Store users and scores in the database.
- Login - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Cannot save score unless logged in. 
- WebSocket - When a user logs in they get a message of the current highest score and the highest score of the next person with a challenge to beat them. 
- React - Application will be ported to use the React web framework.
